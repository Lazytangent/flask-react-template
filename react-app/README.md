This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Make sure to install dependencies in here with `npm install`.

Your React App will live here.  While is development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to run this application in development, but be sure to set the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` environment variable in the Dockerfile in the root of this repository! It needs to match the url at which Heroku will host your site.

This app will be automatically built when you deploy to heroku.
